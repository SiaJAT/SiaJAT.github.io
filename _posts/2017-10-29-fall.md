This coming fall   
One might find that   
The wind may grow brisk   
The days, shorter and   
The nights, long and heavy   
But the leaves have not a care—-   
It’s a second spring for them.   
Flush with warmth and   
longing for a new embrace,   
They take their easy descent   
from the branches.   

_But for us men, it’s not so easy._   

I thought it’d be wise   
to prepare for the season   
To satisfy my sartorial whims   
With some coats, cardigans,   
boots to keep the warmth within.   
The cold’s coming is indisputable after all   
Like the fact that that you’re with him—-    
The earth moves round the sun   
Another day to depart,   
Another day having begun,   
In these fall days   
I’ll be in the company of friends.   

_But I know how this sun sets._   
_I know how it will end._   

Because this coming fall,   
We’ll live on borrowed time and   
Despite our conversations, coffee,   
(sometimes, libations)   
The little moments in between,   
The days’ mundane and those mirthful nights,   
I scarcely believe you’ll ever be mine.   
And like the clocks this fall, we’ll someday rewind   
to a time when we’re just memories,   
and we’ll be strangers again.   

But while the leaves take their leave,   
From the embrace of the trees,   
We labor in the fields:   
The bitter harvest we must reap,   
To which we must attend.   
This coming fall, my hands grow numb   
Growing cold, lacking others to hold.      
And I do think to myself   
Someday, I too will be tired and too old   
To drive this plough with resolution   
To sow again, and to sow again.   
To sow again.   

_Shall I bury the thought deep within?_   
_A grain of wheat upon the ground_    
_Just to die_   
_No new life to begin._   

This coming fall   
will be harder than most.   
To see one you’ll never hold close.   
But It’s fine to live through these times   
Because, after all, seasons change.   
Today like the leaves, I too will descend   
This Fall is here today   
But a new one shall come again.
