_From conversations, relationships, and experiences of Year 24..._


## On Charity

> "As a general rule, **people**, *_even the wicked_*, are much more naive and simple-hearted than we suppose. **And we ourselves are, too**" - Dostoevsky

## On Consistency

> "Above all, don't lie to yourself. THe man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others." -- Dostoevsky

## On Love

> "Strive to love your neighbor actively and indefatigably. In as far as you advance in love you will grow surer of the reality of God and of the immortality of your soul. If you attain to perfect self-forgetfulness in the love of your neighbor, then you will believe without doubt, and no doubt can possibly enter your soul. This has been tried. This is certain."  -- Dostoevsky
