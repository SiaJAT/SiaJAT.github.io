***

I had a little dream   
To hold you in my arms  
And make you laugh—  
To give you the best  
But your smile was always tenuous  
Like the tired hope in my chest  
That wanted for more  
(You always wanted less)  

Bated breath,  
And tearful embrace.  
Wound so tight,  
Together, but alone.  
In the weary night,  
Filled, but left wanting.  
As the heart drops,  
Another star falls.  
—and I grow tired of these telephone calls.  
Should we put it on the line?  
Or do nothing at all?  

There’s no tender gazes or glances—  
Just ill-fated romances,  
Like cups of coffee, sugar, and cream:  
The bitter and sweet muddled,  
like a confused, recollecting dream.  
We were true for a time,  
But not true in due time.  
The glint was gone from your eyes  
And tonight I lie in bed and cry  
And forget what you meant to me.
