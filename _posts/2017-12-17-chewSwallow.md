What flavors do you remember most?  

Do you remember the young togethers that were  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sweet to the taste?  
When love was wrapped in cellophane--  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those loud, bright, and youthful days  
And candied memories suspended  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in syrupy nostalgia.  

Do you remember the lonely aparts?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days when salt had lost its savor  
When you were left hungering for a something  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that could not be and would never be,  
Left wandering in imagination  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and unwilling to digest that bitter reality.  

Do you remember the mundane specials?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the blue plate of another today  
Holding steady, keeping due course  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with dreams in the head, work on the hands  
Though we may not taste love today  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have more than enough sustenance.  

Do you remember those cozy nights?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire of comrades to raise the spirits  
It’s an honest flavor rarely surpassed  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A time-tested classic never too tired  
After all, the taste of friendship isn’t too heavy  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only light and warming, comforting to the soul.  

There are so many things to remember  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with all that’s been on the plate  
I hope you take in the flavors of life:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sweet and the savory  
Among the bland and the bitter  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--They all have their place at the table  
It’s a thought, you know?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something to chew,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something to swallow.
