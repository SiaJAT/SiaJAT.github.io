***

I’m tied to these delicate  
threads of circumstance,  
hesitating on the moment  
whether I should ask you  
to stay with me and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to dance.  
These are the threads that  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hold me in place:  
the fine fine frenzy,  
the Saturday scene,  
And gin blossoms on your face  

With the sound and the fury  
The noise and the heat  
the flash of the lights  
We’ll follow the usual turn of the night  
After all, It is better to laugh than to weep;  
To dance than to sleep  
----For in sleep dreams are born;  
and in dreams, foolish things, foolish thoughts:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like believing I know  
what love must be  
when you lay your your head on my shoulder  
To repose amidst the revelry.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll bottle us in memory  
As you sleep and dream comfortably  
Distilling ten thousand sorrows,  
To revisit tomorrow  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with rueful reverie.  
For a few more useless days.  

But, will you remember?  
Will I recall?  
The fine fine frenzy  
The Saturday scene  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too many gins in  
With one you knew  
But didn’t know at all  

Though I’m ripe to contemplate  
It’s the thought that easily escapes  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the rhythm and the rhyme  
and the cadence of your call,  
In the dizzy of the disco,  
I struggle with the cans and cannots,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That which is and that which ought,  
Thoughts that punctuate the haze,  
leaving only to frustrate,  
For you to circle ‘round so many times  
to fall back on the solitary fact  
that some things cannot be  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misery does love company…  
and soon the clock will strike 3  
and I’ll realize we’re at it again.  
---Past the fine fine frenzy  
and the Saturday scene  
All I wanted to do was hold your hand  
And say what I mean.
