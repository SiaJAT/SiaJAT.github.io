_Summing up the previous year--far from home, and alone._


## On Consistency, Symmetry

> "_It is much more **immoral** to **claim virtue** without living with its **direct consequences.**_" -- NNT

> "_If your **private life conflicts** with your **intellectual opinion**, it **cancels** your **intellectual ideas**, not your **private life.**_" -- NNT

## On Virtue

> "_**Love** without sacrifice is like **theft.**_" -- NNT

> "_**A man is morally free** when, in full possession of his living humanity, **he judges** the world, and **judges** other **men**, with uncompromising sincerity._" -- George Santayana

> "_**Courage** is the only virtue you **cannot fake.**_" -- NNT

> "_If you see **fraud** and do not **say** fraud, **you are a fraud.**_" -- NNT

> "_Compendiaria res improbitas, virtusque tarda._" -- Roman quote

## On Thinking Things Through

> “_**Meditation** is a way to be narcissistic without hurting anyone._” -- NNT

> "_There is no such thing as **'rationality' of a belief**, there is **rationality of action.**_" -- NNT

> “_A **thought**, even a **possibility**, can shatter and transform us._” -- Nietzsche

## On Meaning

> "_**'Vanity of vanities,'** says the Preacher; 'Vanity of vanities, **all is vanity.**'_" -- Ecclesiastes 1:2

> "_**Success** has always been a great liar._" -- Nietzsche

## On Practicality

> "_One ought to **hold** onto to **one's heart**; for if one **lets it go**, one soon **loses control** of the **head** too._" -- Nietzsche

> "_In a strategy that entails **ruin**, the benefits **never offset the risk**._" -- NNT

> "_We're all **unlucky in love** sometimes. When I am, I go jogging. The body loses water when you jog, so you have **none left for tears.**_" -- Cop 223, Chungking Express

> "_Not everything that **happens**, happens for a **reason**, but **everything that survives, survives for a reason.**_" -- NNT

> "_I've been such a fool, Vassili. **Man will always be man. There is no new man.** We tried so hard to create a society that was equal, where there'd be nothing to envy your neighbour. But there's always **something to envy.** A smile, a friendship, something you don't have and want to appropriate. In this world...**there will always be rich and poor.** Rich in **gifts,** poor in gifts. **Rich in love, poor in love.**_" -- Commisar Danilov, Enemy at the Gates

## On Modern Life

> “_**Modernity**: we created youth without **heroism**, age without **wisdom**, and life without **grandeur**._” -- NNT
