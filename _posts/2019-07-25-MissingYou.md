***

I miss all the times--  
When the morn was young and  
When the sun was still yawning,  
Stretching its eager rays across the sky  
And onto your gentle face  
--But all that's left now is empty space.  
There's a hole in my chest knowing you're gone  
Breath, light, sight  
a memory of a time and place, fixed  
_If only we could've fixed?_  
We had our days and ways  
--imperfect, but bright and  
lovely all the same, giving way to  
Sweet, languid afternoon  
_We'll get up eventually...soon_  
and lay down our worries for  
another time, another place.  

I miss all the little things--  
The way we'd walk  
And talk,  
And sleep.  
The way we'd laugh,  
and play,  
and eat:  
The gentle rhythm of the day to day.  
It's something we know but forget:  
That the music of life is in  
The little joys in living,  
The almond joys in your bag,  
And waiting for your embrace  
When you'd come home to my arms  
After a long day.  
--This tired life isn't worth living  
Without a bit of tenderness,  
lots of good intentions,  
And kisses on your cheek.  

I miss you and me  
Our time fading to memory  
Rumination, and revery.  
I always thought and felt  
We'd have a house built for three:  
for our love, for you, and for me.  
For now, I can only pray  
That once more we'll be together someday,  
When the morn is still young,  
and our sunshine is here to stay.  

Today, however, I will miss you.
