Ah yes, Queen City. Emerald City. The City of Flowers. Seattle, you are magnificent 

## Natural Surroundings: 5/5 ##
It would be foolish to debate this point. Nestled amidst mountains in the distance, the location of the city itself on Puget sound, with its many hills and bodies of water (namely, Lake Washington, Lake Union and Puget Sound) leaves a lasting impression. Natural beauty, free of the commotion of the city, is readily within reach. For the time cost of a rush-hour commute in my hometown of Houston (30 minutes-1.5 hours), hikes 

## Jobs 5/5 ##
The amount of opportunities seem endless here. 

## Social Atmosphere: 2/5 ##
To preface, I've met a lot of amazing people in Seattle. I have had and continue to have amazing job opportunities in the Seattle area. I had and have bosses who care about my welfare, morale, and career progression to which I am deeply indebted. I am also thankful for the love and care of my familiy who live in the area. I've had many wonderful, often thought-provoking conversations in my nights out on the town thus far and have met many, many interesting people.

That being said, Seattle's social atemosphere leaves much to be desired. That being said, there are the little things to be desired; and also, the big. 


## The (Not So) Little Things
The little things that I so often overlooked in Texas -- being able to shoot the breeze in the grocery store, joking about things with strangers in line, striking up a conversation in a bar -- simply don't exist in Seattle. Social niceties are dying, foreign, or largely nonexistent for the under 65 population. While I've had many positive interactions with the seemingly retired folks here (I'll make small talk with them in the elevator of my condo or while queueing for croissants at my favorite French bakery), I can't count the number of times I've been bumped into without a reciprocal "excuse me", been given weird looks for saying "good morning" while walking around the park, or having the door outright slam in my face by someone walking in front of me.

More so than Texas, there is a certain degree of indifference to the other people and their lives that permeates every day social interaction. Such a disposition manifests itself in little ways -- from more people than not letting you merge in traffic and/or driving slow in the passing lane, slow/inattentive/morose waitstaff -- and larger ways such as total disregard for a child being clearly walloped in public eye at the Westlake light rail train station. I remember helping an elderly man who was struggling to carry his luggage off the bus when no one else but batted an eye. Before exiting the bus a few stops later, a couple went out of their way to tell me at how much of a "gentleman" I was for helping the poor guy. Its frankly disgusting how affording people basic human decency and regard is treated as "special" in this city. 

In addition, human interaction and connection feels tenuous and strained at time -- the people feel just as chilly as the weather. I miss the days of being able to strike up to easily strike up conversations with people in bars or dance clubs like I was able to in Austin. Flakiness and bailing are more common than I would like (even for my generation). You have to go the extra mile here: From my experiences, many people have the basic politeness to offer to meet up but the onus will inevitably be on **YOU** to follow up and make plans with the hopes they don't cancel last minute.


## The Big Things
Even more disconcerting is the degree of racism and ignorance, I have witnessed and experienced in recent memory. For a city that prides itself as a bastion of progressive politics and equality for all people, I have had witnessed an alarming number of degrading or questionable comments concerning my or another person's race or ethnicity. Just last week, a cashier of South Asian heritage at a 7-11 near my downtown office being told to "learn to speak English" and having money thrown at him by a customer, who was seemingly aggrieved at the "lack of online delivery" that 7-11 failed to offer. I've been told in a bar that my Filipino ethnic roots give me mystic powers, and a neighborhood YMCA staff asking how to pronounce my last name because "we Americans just don't know other languages than English" (Ditto, lol). A certain part of me isn't surprised, as one of my aunties recounts being told "to go back where she came from" while dining at the <a href="https://www.newcastlegolf.com/">Newcastle Golf Club</a> with my infant newphew and my uncle. I personally being given death stares at a stop light years ago with my dad while we were driving a rental car in the Eastside. 

Liberal, progressive politics has its limits in this city. People will scream equality and justice from the hills, but when, God-forbid, someone suggests <a href="https://seattle.curbed.com/2018/8/23/17760686/hala-mha-upzone-appeal-legislation">upzoning single-family home</a> to avoid the <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/reports/2015/finance/housing-costs/housing-costs.aspx">housing pathologies of Northern California</a>, NIMBYism seems to dominate: <a href="https://thecisforcrank.com/2019/03/04/after-five-years-seattles-scaled-back-density-plan-moves-forward/">"I'll take what's mine, and don't you dare touch it."</a>. This mentality is what has resulted in a drastically scaled-back upzoning proposal that has meandered its way to approval by city council.  It's capital-"I" indifference at its finest.
